During this project, I was able to:
- Develop a backend application utilizing a Neo4j graph database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Learned how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a NestJS application using GitLab CI/CD, including lint analysis, unit testing, and code coverage verification.
- Used Terraform to implement IaC (Infrastructure as a Code) principles.
